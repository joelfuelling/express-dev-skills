    // Since you are using Express, the index.js file is typically located in the bin directory and is named www. This file is generated by the Express application generator and is responsible for starting the server and listening for incoming requests. 
    // In summary, the "start" script in your package.json file specifies the file that Node.js should run when you start your Express server, and the absence of a "main" field defaults to the index.js file in the root directory of the package.
